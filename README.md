## Overview

The Mailgun API is part of the Sinch family and enables you to send, track, and receive email effortlessly.

### Base URL

All API calls referenced in our documentation start with a base URL. Mailgun allows the ability to send and receive
email in both US and EU regions. Be sure to use the appropriate base URL based on which region you have created for your
domain.

It is also important to note that Mailgun uses URI versioning for our API endpoints, and some endpoints may have
different versions than others. Please reference the version stated in the URL for each endpoint.

For domains created in our US region the base URL is:

```sh
https://api.mailgun.net/
```

For domains created in our EU region the base URL is:

```sh
https://api.eu.mailgun.net/
```

Your Mailgun account may contain multiple sending domains. To avoid passing the domain name as a query parameter, most
API URLs must include the name of the domain you are interested in:

```sh
https://api.mailgun.net/v3/mydomain.com
```

### Authentication

The Mailgun Send API uses your API key for authentication. [Grab](https://app.mailgun.com/settings/api_security) and
save your Mailgun API credentials.

To run tests and examples please use virtualenv or conda environment with next environment variables:

```bash
export APIKEY="API_KEY"  # pragma: allowlist secret
export DOMAIN="DOMAIN_NAME"
export MESSAGES_FROM="Name Surname <mailgun@domain_name>"
export MESSAGES_TO="Name Surname <username@gmail.com>"
export MESSAGES_CC="Name Surname <username2@gmail.com>"
export DOMAINS_DEDICATED_IP="127.0.0.1"
export MAILLIST_ADDRESS="everyone@mailgun.domain.com"
export VALIDATION_ADDRESS_1="test1@i.ua"
export VALIDATION_ADDRESS_2="test2@gmail.com"
export MAILGUN_EMAIL="username@example.com"
export USER_ID="123456789012345678901234"
export USER_NAME="Name Surname"
export ROLE="admin"
```

## Quick Start

The Mailgun Send API uses your API key for authentication.

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Client.

### Client

Initialize your [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) client:

```python
from mailgun.client import Client
import os

auth = ("api", os.environ["APIKEY"])
client = Client(auth=auth)
```

#### Client Lifecycle & Resource Management

> [!TIP]
> **New in v1.7.0:** The SDK now utilizes connection pooling (`requests.Session`) under the hood to dramatically improve performance by reusing TLS connections.

**The Simple Variant (Backward Compatible)**
For simple scripts, lambdas, or single-request apps, you can initialize and use the client directly. Python's garbage collector will eventually clean up the connection.

```python
client = Client(auth=("api", "KEY"))
client.messages.create(data={"to": "user@example.com"})
```

**The Recommended Variant (Context Manager)**

[!WARNING]

If you are running long-lived applications (like Celery workers, web servers, or high-volume loops), repeatedly initializing the `Client` without closing it can lead to socket leaks (`Too many open files`).

For production applications, \**always use the client as a Context Manager* (`with`) or explicitly call `client.close()`. This ensures deterministic release of TCP connection pools.

```python
# Sockets are safely managed and closed automatically
with Client(auth=("api", "KEY")) as client:
    client.messages.create(data={"to": "user@example.com"})
```

#### Advanced Configuration

By default, the SDK routes traffic to the US servers (`https://api.mailgun.net`). If you are operating in the EU, you can override the base URL during initialization:

```python
client = Client(auth=("api", "KEY"), api_url="https://api.eu.mailgun.net")
```

The SDK also implements Timeouts by default `read=60.0s` (but can take a tuple with connect/read `(10.0, 60.0)` to ensure your application fails-fast during network partitions but remains patient while Mailgun processes heavy analytical queries.

### AsyncClient

SDK provides also async version of the client to use in asynchronous applications. The AsyncClient offers the same functionality as the sync client but with non-blocking I/O, making it ideal for concurrent operations and integration with asyncio-based applications.

```python
from mailgun.client import AsyncClient
import os

auth = ("api", os.environ["APIKEY"])
client = AsyncClient(auth=auth)
```

## Usage

Send a message with a Synchronous Client.

```python
import os
from mailgun.client import Client

# Initialize the client
client = Client(auth=("api", os.environ["APIKEY"]))

# Send an email
response = client.messages.create(
    data={
        "from": "Excited User <mailgun@sandbox.mailgun.org>",
        "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
        "subject": "Hello from Mailgun Python SDK",
        "text": "Testing some Mailgun awesomeness!",
    }
)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

The `AsyncClient` provides async equivalents for all methods available in the sync `Client`. The method signatures and parameters are identical - simply add `await` when calling methods:

```python
# Sync version
client = Client(auth=auth)
result = client.domainlist.get()

# Async version
client = AsyncClient(auth=auth)
result = await client.domainlist.get()
```

Additionally `AsyncClient` can be used as async context manager to automatically close connection when execution is finished:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from mailgun.client import AsyncClient


async def main():
    auth = ("api", os.environ["APIKEY"])
    async with AsyncClient(auth=auth) as client:
        result = await client.domainlist.get()
        print(result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

For detailed examples of all available methods, parameters, and use cases, refer to the [mailgun/examples](mailgun/examples) section. All examples can be adapted to async by using `AsyncClient` and adding `await` to method calls.

### Logging & Debugging

The Mailgun SDK includes built-in logging to help you troubleshoot API requests, inspect generated URLs, and read server error messages (like `400 Bad Request` or `404 Not Found`).

The SDK uses the standard Python `logging` module under the namespace `mailgun.client`.

To enable detailed logging in your application, configure the logger before initializing the client:

```python
import logging
from mailgun.client import Client

# Enable DEBUG level for the Mailgun SDK logger
logging.getLogger("mailgun.client").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure the basic console output (if not already configured in your app)
logging.basicConfig(format="%(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s")

# Now, any API errors or requests will be printed to your console
client = Client(auth=("api", "YOUR_API_KEY"))
client.domains.get()
```

### IDE Autocompletion & DX

The `Client` utilizes a dynamic routing engine but is heavily optimized for modern Developer Experience (DX).

- **Introspection**: Calling `dir(client)` or using autocomplete in IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm will automatically expose all available API endpoints (e.g., `client.messages`, `client.domains`, `client.bounces`).
- **Security Guardrails**: If you accidentally print the client instance or an exception traceback occurs in your CI/CD logs, your API key is strictly redacted from memory dumps: (`'api', '***REDACTED***'`).
- **Performance**: JSON payloads are automatically minified before transit to save bandwidth on large batch requests, and internal route resolution is heavily cached in memory.

### API Response Codes

All of Mailgun's HTTP response codes follow standard HTTP definitions. For some additional information and
troubleshooting steps, please see below.

**400** - Bad Request (e.g., missing parameter). Will typically contain a JSON response with a "message" key which contains a human readable message / action
to interpret.

**401/403** - Auth error or access denied. Please ensure your API key is correct and that you are part of a group that has
access to the desired resource.

**404** - Resource not found. NOTE: this one can be temporal as our system is an eventually-consistent system but
requires diligence. If a JSON response is missing for a 404 - that's usually a sign that there was a mistake in the API
request, such as a non-existing endpoint.

**429** - Rate limit exceeded. Mailgun does have rate limits in place to protect our system. The SDK automatically retries these using Exponential Backoff. In the unlikely case you encounter them and need them raised, please reach out to our support team.

**500/502/503** - Internal Error on the Mailgun side. The SDK automatically retries these using Exponential Backoff.
If the issue persists, please reach out to our support team.

## Request examples

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> This is a full list of supported endpoints this SDK provides [mailgun/examples](mailgun/examples)

### Messages

#### Send an email

Pass the components of the messages such as To, From, Subject, HTML and text parts, attachments, etc. Mailgun will build
a MIME representation of the message and send it. Note: In order to send you must provide one of the following
parameters: 'text', 'html', 'amp-html' or 'template'

```python
data = {
    "from": "test@test.com",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello from python!",
    "text": "Hello world!",
}
req = client.messages.create(data=data)
```

#### Send an email with advanced parameters (Tags, Testmode, STO)

Because the SDK maps kwargs directly to the payload, it inherently supports all advanced Mailgun features without needing SDK updates. You can easily add custom variables (`v:`), options (`o:`), and Send Time Optimization (STO) directly to your data dictionary.

```python
data = {
    "from": "Excited User <mailgun@my-domain.com>",
    "to": ["recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com"],
    "subject": "Advanced Mailgun Features",
    "text": "Testing out tags, custom variables, and testmode!",
    "o:tag": ["newsletter", "python-sdk"],  # Multiple tags
    "o:testmode": "yes",  # Validates payload without actually sending
    "o:deliverytime-optimize-period": "24h",  # Send Time Optimization
    "v:my-custom-id": "USER-12345",  # Custom user-defined variable
}
req = client.messages.create(data=data)
```

#### Send an email with attachments

It is strongly recommended that you open files in binary mode (`read_bytes()`).

```python
from pathlib import Path

files = [("attachment", ("report.pdf", Path("report.pdf").read_bytes()))]
req = client.messages.create(data=data, files=files)
```

#### Send a scheduled message

```python
def post_scheduled() -> None:
    # Scheduled message
    data = {
        "from": os.environ["MESSAGES_FROM"],
        "to": os.environ["MESSAGES_TO"],
        "cc": os.environ["MESSAGES_CC"],
        "subject": "Hello Vasyl Bodaj",
        "html": html,
        "o:deliverytime": "Thu Jan 28 2021 14:00:03 EST",
    }

    req = client.messages.create(data=data, domain=domain)
    print(req.json())
```

#### Send a MIME message

When using the .mimemessage endpoint, Mailgun strictly requires the payload to be sent as multipart/form-data. In Python, you trigger this by passing the raw MIME string via the files parameter, assigning it to the "message" key.

```python
mime_string = (
    "From: sender@example.com\n"
    "To: recipient@example.com\n"
    "Subject: MIME Test\n"
    "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n\n"
    "This is a raw MIME message."
).encode("utf-8")

# Force multipart/form-data by passing `files`
req = client.mimemessage.create(
    domain=domain,
    data={"to": "recipient@example.com"},
    files={"message": ("message.mime", mime_string)},
)

print(req.json())
```

### Domains

#### Get domains

```python
data = client.domainlist.get()
print(data.json())
```

#### Get domains with filters

```python
data = client.domainlist.get(filters={"skip": 0, "limit": 10})
print(data.json())
```

#### Get domains details

```python
domain_name = "python.test.com"
data = client.domains.get(domain_name=domain_name)
print(data.json())
```

#### Create a domain

```python
data = {"name": "new.domain.com"}
req = client.domains.create(data=data)
```

#### Update a domain

```python
def update_simple_domain() -> None:
    """
    PUT /domains/<domain>
    :return:
    """
    domain_name = "python.test.domain5"
    data = {"name": domain_name, "spam_action": "disabled"}
    request = client.domains.put(data=data, domain=domain_name)
    print(request.json())
```

#### Domain connections

```python
def get_connections() -> None:
    """
    GET /domains/<domain>/connection
    :return:
    """
    request = client.domains_connection.get(domain=domain)
    print(request.json())
```

### Domain keys

#### List keys for all domains

List domain keys, and optionally filter by signing domain or selector. The page & limit data is only required when paging through the data.

```python
def get_dkim_keys() -> None:
    """
    GET /v1/dkim/keys
    :return:
    """
    data = {
        "page": "string",
        "limit": "0",
        "signing_domain": "python.test.domain5",
        "selector": "smtp",
    }

    request = client.dkim_keys.get(data=data)
    print(request.json())
```

#### Create a domain key

Create a domain key.
Note that once private keys are created or imported they are never exported.
Alternatively, you can import an existing PEM file containing a RSA private key in PKCS #1, ASn.1 DER format.
Note, the pem can be passed as a file attachment or as a form-string parameter.

```python
def post_dkim_keys() -> None:
    """
    POST /v1/dkim/keys
    :return:
    """
    import os
    import re
    import subprocess
    from pathlib import Path

    secret_key_filename: str = os.environ["SECRET_KEY_FILENAME"]
    secret_key_path: Path = Path(secret_key_filename)
    ALLOWED_FILENAME_RE = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,255}$")

    # Private key PEM file must be generated in PKCS1 format. You need 'openssl' on your machine
    # example:
    # openssl genrsa -traditional -out .server.key 2048
    if not ALLOWED_FILENAME_RE.match(secret_key_filename):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid filename: {secret_key_filename!r}")
    subprocess.run(
        ["openssl", "genrsa", "-traditional", "-out", secret_key_filename, "--", "2048"], check=True
    )

    files = [
        (
            "pem",
            ("server.key", secret_key_path.read_bytes()),
        )
    ]

    data = {
        "signing_domain": "python.test.domain5",
        "selector": "smtp",
        "bits": "2048",
        "pem": files,
    }

    headers = {"Content-Type": "multipart/form-data"}

    request = client.dkim_keys.create(data=data, headers=headers, files=files)
    print(request.json())
```

##### Update DKIM authority

```python
def put_dkim_authority() -> None:
    """
    PUT /domains/<domain>/dkim_authority
    :return:
    """
    data = {"self": "false"}
    request = client.domains_dkimauthority.put(domain=domain, data=data)
    print(request.json())
```

#### Domain Tracking

##### Get tracking settings

```python
def get_tracking() -> None:
    """
    GET /domains/<domain>/tracking
    :return:
    """
    request = client.domains_tracking.get(domain=domain)
    print(request.json())
```

### Webhooks

The SDK utilizes Payload-Based Routing. You do not need to worry about calling `/v1`, `/v3`, or `/v4` APIs.
Simply use `client.domains_webhooks` and the SDK will automatically analyze your payload (e.g., looking for `event_types`) and upgrade the request to the modern `v4` multi-event API if applicable.

#### Create a webhook (v4 Multi-Event)

```python
data = {
    "event_types": "clicked,opened,delivered",  # Triggers v4 routing
    "url": "[https://my-server.com/webhook](https://my-server.com/webhook)",
}
req = client.domains_webhooks.create(data=data)
```

#### Get all webhooks

```python
req = client.domains_webhooks.get()
```

#### Create Account-Level Webhooks (v1)

```python
data = {"id": "clicked", "url": ["https://my-server.com/webhook"]}
req = client.account_webhooks.create(data=data)
```

### Events

#### Retrieves a paginated list of events

```python
domain: str = os.environ["DOMAIN"]

req = client.events.get(domain=domain)
print(req.json())
```

#### Get events by recipient

```python
params = {
    "begin": "Tue, 24 Nov 2025 09:00:00 -0000",
    "limit": 10,
    "recipient": "user@example.com",
}
req = client.events.get(filters=params)
```

### Bounce Classification

[API endpoint](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/api-reference/send/mailgun/bounce-classification).

#### List statistic v2

Items that have no bounces and no delays(classified_failures_count==0) are not returned.

```python
domain: str = os.environ["DOMAIN"]

payload = {
    "start": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 23:00:00 UTC",
    "end": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 23:00:00 UTC",
    "resolution": "day",
    "duration": "24h0m0s",
    "dimensions": ["entity-name", "domain.name"],
    "metrics": [
        "critical_bounce_count",
        "non_critical_bounce_count",
        "critical_delay_count",
        "non_critical_delay_count",
        "delivered_smtp_count",
        "classified_failures_count",
        "critical_bounce_rate",

import os

from mailgun.client import Client


key: str = os.environ["APIKEY"]
domain: str = os.environ["DOMAIN"]
mailgun_email = os.environ["MAILGUN_EMAIL"]
role = os.environ["ROLE"]
user_id = os.environ["USER_ID"]
user_name = os.environ["USER_NAME"]

client: Client = Client(auth=("api", key))


def post_keys() -> None:
    """
    POST /v1/keys

    This code generate a Web API key tied to the account user associated with the data inputted for the USER_EMAIL field and USER_ID  values.
    This is returned by the API in the "secret":"API_KEY" key/value pair. This key will authenticate the call (Get one's own user details) made to the /v5/users/me endpoint,   # pragma: allowlist secret
    and will return the user's data associated with the USER_EMAIL and USER_ID values.

    Important Notes:
    USER_EMAIL - The user login email address of the user that is trying to make the call to the /v5/users/me endpoint.
    SECONDS - How many seconds you want the key to be active before it expires.
    ROLE - The role of the API Key. This dictates what permissions the key has (https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/26016288026907-API-Key-Roles)
    USER_ID - The internal User ID of the user that is trying to call the /v5/users/me endpoint. This is present in the URL in the address bar when viewing the User details in the GUI or in Admin. Both will show /users/USER_ID in the address.
    DESCRIPTION - Description of the key.

    :return:
    """

    data = {
        "email": mailgun_email,
        "domain_name": "python.test.domain5",
        "kind": "web",
        "expiration": "3600",
        "role": role,
        "user_id": user_id,
        "user_name": user_name,
        "description": "a new key",
    }

    headers = {"Content-Type": "multipart/form-data"}

    req = client.keys.create(data=data, headers=headers)
    print(req.json())
```

### Credentials

#### List Mailgun SMTP credential metadata for a given domain

```python
request = client.domains_credentials.get(domain=domain)
print(request.json())
```

#### Create Mailgun SMTP credentials for a given domain

```python
data = {
    "login": f"alice_bob@{domain}",
    "password": "test_new_creds123",  # pragma: allowlist secret
}
request = client.domains_credentials.create(domain=domain, data=data)
print(request.json())
```

### Users

#### Get users on an account

```python
query = {"role": "admin", "limit": "0", "skip": "0"}
req = client.users.get(filters=query)
print(req.json())
```

#### Get a user's details

```python
mailgun_email = os.environ["MAILGUN_EMAIL"]
role = os.environ["ROLE"]
user_name = os.environ["USER_NAME"]

query = {"role": role, "limit": "0", "skip": "0"}
req1 = client.users.get(filters=query)
users = req1.json()["users"]

for user in users:
    if mailgun_email == user["email"]:
        req2 = client.users.get(user_id=user["id"])
        print(req2.json())
```

### Validations & Optimize APIs

Thanks to the dynamic routing engine, the SDK natively supports Mailgun's supplementary APIs (like Email Validation, InboxReady, and Send Time Optimization) out of the box, automatically handling the versioning (v4, v5, etc.).

#### Email validation

##### Create a single validation

```python
data = {"address": "test2@gmail.com"}
params = {"provider_lookup": "false"}
req = client.addressvalidate.create(domain=domain, data=data, filters=params)
print(req.json())
```

##### Validate an email address

```python
# Note: Requires a paid Mailgun plan.
req = client.addressvalidate.get(address="suspicious@example.com")
```

#### Inbox placement

##### Get all inbox

```python
req = client.inbox_tests.get(domain=domain)
print(req.json())
```

##### Fetch InboxReady placement tests

```python
req = client.inboxready_domains.get()
print(req.json())
```

## Deprecation Warnings

The SDK includes an active Interceptor engine that protects your application from API drift.

If you attempt to call a legacy or deprecated Mailgun endpoint (such as the old `v3` address validation or `v1` bounce classification), the SDK will **not** break your code.
It will successfully execute the request but will emit a non-breaking Python `DeprecationWarning` and print a logger warning with instructions on which modern API endpoint to migrate to.

## Type Hinting

This SDK is fully type-hinted and compatible with static type checkers like `mypy` and `pyright`.

Because of the dynamic URL dispatch engine (`__getattr__`), IDEs may flag endpoints like `client.messages.create` as `Any`.
If you enforce strict typing in your application, you may safely ignore these specific dynamically dispatched calls.
